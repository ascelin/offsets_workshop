1. TG-Low
NA
darkblue : NA
red : probability of some opportunist (acacia) recruitment, also some dieback of existing loners
pink : Typical activities change from current to more urban residential influence but these don't really impact trees
lightblue : NA
orange : It often takes positive management intervention to prevent trees establishing - in the absence of such intervention recruitment opportunities are likely to occur occasionally
green : Assumes landower continues scubbing, clearing etc
darkgreen : Cover may increase but generally do not observe diversity to increase


NA
darkblue : NA
red : removal of grazing allows volunteer recruitment from eucs with seed source and acacias
pink : Have planted nothing but some new species likely to emerge - probably Acacias
lightblue : species diversity will increase through slow colonisation
orange : Some basic natural recovery& recuitment facilitated by better management - assumption that site is not conmpletely isolated wrt recruitment inputs
green : Assumes natural recruitment and remnant seed bank
darkgreen : Does not include revegetation


NA
darkblue : NA
red : worst case - few spp planted and not all persist; most commonly modest diversity planted and nearly all survive, some supplementary planting after 40 yrs. Even with generously diverse plantings, 6 spp/plot is reasonable upper bound
pink : Relatively easy to put this timber back in under high intensity - as site matures diversity in any one plot dials back due to maturity or senescence
lightblue : active restoration plantings are likely and required in the scenario
orange : Assumption that diverse plantings of trees are likely in first years, gradually reduced by attrition
green : Dramatic increase as a result of planting etc.
darkgreen : Revegetation can increase species diversity however observion is that this generally declines over time - not self-recruiting over long time frames 


2. TG-Med1
NA
darkblue : NA
red : stochastic recruitment from dispersal assume intensification of modest historic grazing regime to 'typical' levels, attrition of old trees
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : senescence and failure of recruitment is likely. Species composition changes may not be reflected in diversity
orange : It often takes positive management intervention to prevent trees establishing - in the absence of such intervention recruitment opportunities are likely to occur occasionally, e.g. after fires
green : NA
darkgreen : Cover may increase but generally do not observe diversity to increase


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Marginally different from previous, given low levels of grazing in that scenario
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : likely to lead to a general improving trend
orange : Some basic natural recovery& recuitment facilitated by better management - assumption that site is not conmpletely isolated wrt recruitment inputs
green : Based on natural recuitment 
darkgreen : Does not include revegetation


NA
darkblue : NA
red : best case scenario - planting to benchmark results in self sustaining tree diversity. Upper bound based on overplanting
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : NA
orange : Assumption that diverse plantings of trees are likely in first years, gradually reduced by attrition
green : Limted planting of tree type species to supp natural recruitment 
darkgreen : Revegetation can increase species diversity however observion is that this generally declines over time - not self-recruiting over long time frames 


3. TG-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : "locked stand" entry of new spp largely prevented by dense canopy & grazing some chance of stochastic colonisation in future
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : NA
orange : Dense weed cover limits natural (unassisted) recruitment, likely that trees which die willl not be replaced, esppecially as fire is unlikely to open structure for recruits = gradual decline
green : NA
darkgreen : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : partial removal of olive allows some colonisation by bird dispersal
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : NA
orange : Dense weed cover limits natural (unassisted) recruitment (as per no management) and it is unlikely that low intensity management will actually improve this - however, it is possible that low intensity management may lead to slight improvement which is reflected in the lower confidence over time about the gradual decline
green : NA
darkgreen : Does not include revegetation


NA
darkblue : NA
red : planting should restore diversity, overplanting and some attition are risks
pink : A lot of canopy already in situ so management not likely to add new canopy
lightblue : NA
orange : Intervention to remove weeds (olive) and add more fire imrproves recruitment, but diverse planting not required due to exiisting canopy - giving pulse of (e.g.) Acacia recruitment which is likely to gradually settle out over time
green : NA
darkgreen : Revegetation can increase species diversity however observion is that this generally declines over time - not self-recruiting over long time frames 


4. TG-High
NA
darkblue : NA
red : Assumes intensification of grazing
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : NA
orange : There is a fair diversity of private land management, hence the range.  I would expect a gradual decline in tree diversity without active management, but there are also likely to be occasional ;pulses of recruitment (e.g. wattles after fire) over the course of decades 
green : NA
darkgreen : NA


5. GG-Low
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay
pink : Benign neglect assumed the land is not developed or altered (market gardens). So status quo of what has survived the last 50 years likely to be robust to continue 
lightblue : ongoing mgt is likely to retain current taxa (tolerant species / unpalatable species). History of site much longer than 60 years given here.
orange : Species remaining in these sites are likely to be quite resilient, and while there may be a gradual reduction through stochastic events, there may also be occasional recruitment, These sites are starting at a low level already.
green : NA
darkgreen : Persistent species


NA
darkblue : NA
red : kick up after olive control but slow colonisation withut active translocation
pink : With removal of high ly competitive weeds, upper limit may move but dependent on vectors to supply new species. These vectors will be limited as surrounding development occurs
lightblue : likely to have grasses disperse around a site so plots will gain species slowly
orange : These sites have great capacity for improvement, and the removal of weeds and introduction of burniing is likely to lead to new regeneration and recruitment.  Recruitment may be constrained by lack of propagules, however.
green : NA
darkgreen : Experience shows this condition state rarely recruits new species without direct intense intervention


NA
darkblue : NA
red : assumes lots of planting & intensive weed & nutrient management, doubtfully self-sustaining
pink : Range of new species added dependent on seed availability. Results evedent by year 20 then best estimate reduction as site matures and natural niches occur
lightblue : decrese happens as canopy mgt (planting, maturing) leads to a change in GG species composition which then increases again as canopy matures. Initial burst of persistent species from change in conditions (mix of open and canopy shading)
orange : High intensity management is likely to lead to a good increase in grass diversity, and may include introduction of native spp.  There may be limitations due to historic fertiliser use, but this is perhaps not so likely to affect grass spp. presence, as relative dominance 
green : NA
darkgreen : Grassy-groundcover' (scalp and seed) monitoring by GS LLS shows very good initial results but low resilience and a natural attrition of gains over time


6. GG-Med1
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay in response to grazing intensification
pink : As for GG Low
lightblue : site likely to have been in similar condition state decline for an extended period.
orange : In the absence of positive management, very likely that natives will decline and weeds become more dominant
green : NA
darkgreen : 20-yr observation (315 properties) is of some decline but limited (excluding development)


NA
darkblue : NA
red : maintains diversity or slight improvement due to continuation of mgt similar to historic
pink : As for GG Low
lightblue : Grass and grasslike species are more likely to respond to basic mgt inputs
orange : Introducion of some management, and esp. burning and weed control, likely to increase gras diversity 
green : NA
darkgreen : While regeneration can increase native cover, species diversity does not significantly increase. Both observation & published data confirm this


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Initial enhancement not sustainable as trees increase in cover
pink : Site fairly resilient as evidenced by reasonable original diversity so additional species that have been added are more likely to continue
lightblue : Curve of species diversity is likely to reflect an increase in canopy initially, then a change in composition from a sun loving to a shade tolerant complex of taxa
orange : Positive management may include reintroductions, but numbers likely to relax a little over long-term.
green : NA
darkgreen : Grassy-groundcover' (scalp and seed) monitoring by GS LLS shows very good initial results but low resilience and a natural attrition of gains over time


7. GG-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay
pink : NA
lightblue : Likely to keep losing species under a dense olive canopy as diversity changes from graminoid form towards broadleaf forms of plants that are more shade tolerant
orange : Gradual decline, but these species are already fairly resilient, so deccline is small
green : NA
darkgreen : Typically a stable state of decline - the low number of species which are present are by nature those which can persist under these conditions


NA
darkblue : NA
red : slight kick from grazing removal may not be sustainable as trees thicken further after olive removal
pink : Progressive removal of structure changing threats with continued management assumes that site has resilience and threat has largely been structural changing weeds
lightblue : Removal of olives tends to result in an immediate diversity response (increased light, germination from soil seedbank) and then more taxa immigrate from refugia nearby over time
orange : Introduction of some mannagement (e.g. fire) may have small imcrease in opportunities for recruitment, but low intensity managment will not address major issue (e.g. olives)
green : NA
darkgreen : Generally this condition state has at least some suppressed species (bud and seed bank) which emerge to measurable levels when suppressing canopy is removed


NA
darkblue : NA
red : iniitial plantings.scalping increase richness but not sustainable
pink : As for low intensity management with additional species dispersed through management activities
lightblue : Likely to have a diverse planting initially and then later immigration of other taxa from refugia
orange : Removal of olives and introduction of natives will increase diversity greatly, but likely to be gradual reduction back to more 'natural' levels
green : NA
darkgreen : Grassy-groundcover' (scalp and seed) monitoring by GS LLS shows very good initial results but low resilience and a natural attrition of gains over time


8. GG-High
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay in response to grazing & fert app
pink : Lower bound considers benign neglect does not address structural changing weeds such as Olive or Lovegrass
lightblue : status quo may lead to general slow decline as site is managed 'as is'
orange : Again, a wide range in provate land management, but I would expect a gradual decline without active management of some type
green : NA
darkgreen : There is little observed decline in species diversity in high quality sites. Sites which have survived the previous 200 years of abuse to retain this level of diversity generally remain resilient. However some decline in forbs and herbs can occur through new pressures from adjoining land uses in certain instances


9. FG-Low
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual attrition
pink : Tough forbs remain - eg, Dichondra
lightblue : persistence of tolerant or annual forbs
orange : I would expect a small decline, but these species are already quite resilient, so the decline will be small.
green : NA
darkgreen : Persistent species


NA
darkblue : NA
red : marginal increase with grazing removal, but largey stable thereafter - legacy
pink : removal of threats - particularly grazing could get a big rebound. This is the reason for the seemingly high upper bound
lightblue : Likely to see a rapid initial response of plants to management of the groundcover weed through herbicide and fire
orange : Some management will improve forb diversity, but likely to be limited in some sites by available propagules
green : NA
darkgreen : Experience shows this condition state rarely recruits new species without direct intense intervention


NA
darkblue : NA
red : increase with planting but not sustainable as eucs increase, stochastic losses occur
pink : Upper bound depends on available supply - could go higher. Those that are surviving after 20 years following initial reconstruction are likely to remain with ongoing intense management and ignoring climate change
lightblue : Likely to see a quick response from diversity planting , plateau as canopy thickening occurs, then gradual increase once canopy matures.
orange : Active management will greatly increase forb diversity, perhaps above 'natural' levels
green : NA
darkgreen : Grassy-groundcover' (scalp and seed) monitoring by GS LLS shows very good initial results but low resilience and a natural attrition of gains over time


10. FG-Med1
NA
darkblue : NA
red : decay in response to increased grazing
pink : Trends to low quality state 
lightblue : Likely to see a general decline in species as a result of mt trends (persistent tussock is the more likely occurrence)
orange : In the absence of positive managment, I would expect some decline in diversity.
green : NA
darkgreen : 20-yr observation (315 properties) is of some decline but limited (excluding development)


NA
darkblue : NA
red : maintains or slighty improves in respose to marginal reduction in grazing
pink : The site already has some diversity so any work will provide some rebound that should be easy to maintain with ongoing management. Vectors for new species is likely to reduce after development occurs so any new species likely to show up in first 20 years.
lightblue : Likely to see a general improvement from sward mgt and strategic grazing
orange : Introduction of some management, and particularly fire and weed, will be likely to increase forb diversity a bit 
green : NA
darkgreen : While regeneration can increase native cover, species diversity does not significantly increase. Both observation & published data confirm this


NA
darkblue : NA
red : immediate increase due to transloc, slight attrition subsequently
pink : As for low intensity management but opportunity to add from available supplies
lightblue : Likely to see a rapid gain following commencing site mgt (planting) and then a drop as canopy shading matures and species composition changes from sun tolerant to shade tolerant
orange : Active management will include re-introduction of forbs, and is likely to lead to a slightlly inflated diversity compared to natural situation
green : NA
darkgreen : Grassy-groundcover' (scalp and seed) monitoring by GS LLS shows very good initial results but low resilience and a natural attrition of gains over time


11. FG-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay
pink : Invasive threats progress to further impact
lightblue : Likely to see a continual decline as species are shaded out and groundcover cannot establish in olive-affected lands (allelopathic)
orange : Remaining forbs are likely to be resilient, but may gradually decline
green : NA
darkgreen : Typically a stable state of decline - the low number of species which are present are by nature those which can persist under these conditions


NA
darkblue : NA
red : initial improvement with grazing removal, hits restoration barrier
pink : As for GG Med 2
lightblue : Control of olives leads to a rapid response of species, including many annuals and this is residual for some time although native canopy thickening and recruitment leads to a shading again and change in taxa mix
orange : some management (at least) will improve things a little, but no major change without olives being removed
green : NA
darkgreen : Generally this condition state has at least some suppressed species (bud and seed bank) which emerge to measurable levels when suppressing canopy is removed


NA
darkblue : NA
red : initial increase due to planting not sustainable as eucs increase
pink : As for FG Med 1 but increased existing canopy limits diversity of recruitment. 
lightblue : Likely to see a rapid gain from olive mgt and planting of diversity, briefly plateauing until shade tolerant species immigrate from refugia
orange : Active management will increase diversity above 'natural' levels for a while 
green : NA
darkgreen : Grassy-groundcover' (scalp and seed) monitoring by GS LLS shows very good initial results but low resilience and a natural attrition of gains over time


12. FG-High
NA
darkblue : NA
red : decay in response to grazing intensification
pink : Trends to low quality site due to invasive structural weeds
lightblue : Likely to see a persistent, slow decline from a good starting position as BAU practices see little mgt improvement opportunity
orange : Again, a wide range of management, but gradual decline in diversity is likely without some conscious manamgement actions being taken to prevent decline  
green : NA
darkgreen : There is little observed decline in species diversity in high quality sites. Sites which have survived the previous 200 years of abuse to retain this level of diversity generally remain resilient. However some decline in forbs and herbs can occur through new pressures from adjoining land uses in certain instances


13. TG-Cover-Low
NA
darkblue : NA
red : no increase is worst scenario when trees already absent, some stochastc increase possible under upper bound, some allowance for dieback on best est
pink : Following trend of past 50 years of sites left in benign neglect gaining trees. Worst case is nothing changes
lightblue : Overall the amount of tree cover is unlikely to change but it may become generally younger
orange : Private managmment highly variable, but  likely that some recruitmen of trees may occur over 60 years, unless very active exclusion is happening
green : NA
darkgreen : Landscape scale decline of trees is well documented in both unmanaged (for NRM) and intensively managed (for NRM) sites across the cumberland plain. This is offset by natural recruitment on native pasture, but such recruitment is very rarely observed on exotic pastures where canopy is typically remnant from before intervention. Land management (slashing, grazing) further reduces this


NA
darkblue : NA
red : some recruitment & growth to woody thickening by eucs
pink : Growth and recruitment of canopy trees already in situ
lightblue : Canopy cover returns quickly under appropriate fire regime and grazing mgt
orange : Some management (removal of impacts, adding fire) will increase tree recruitment, sometimess in a major pulse which will takes decades to thin withhoiiut active management
green : NA
darkgreen : See above. Low intensity management does not incorporate revegetation


NA
darkblue : NA
red : dense tree planting, locked stand scenario except where plantings are lower initial density
pink : Mass planting and management provides the ability to engineer this outcome. Trees are the easy win on a site that is protected and can be managed
lightblue : Canopy cover can be restored relatively quickly at low cost, although the stems will tend to be poor habitat. The likelihood of exceeding these values is also high
orange : Optimal management should result in stable tree cover 
green : NA
darkgreen : Revegetation can increase cover however observion is that this generally declines over time where native groundcovers are not prevalent


14. TG-Cover-Med1
NA
darkblue : NA
red : some attrition and little recruitment
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Likely to remain at similar cover percentage, but confidence decreases to reflect uncertainty
orange : Native tree species are generally resilient, but likely to be limited by ongoing grazing, competition from exotic ground cover and lack of burning
green : NA
darkgreen : Landscape scale decline is expected, outbalanced by natural regeneration which occurs strongly where native groundcovers are present, but balanced by land management (grazing or slashing). Our observation is that across the Cumberland Plain tree cover is increasing on unmanaged lands


NA
darkblue : NA
red : some grwoth and auto-recruitment, starts to abate in upper bound
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Will see a slow increase in tree cover under mgt
orange : Exclusion of grazing, burning and weed management will greatly improve tree recruitment, but it may be limited by low initial cover limiting numbers and distribution of propagules- however general experience across western Sydney has shown that vigorous recruitment of trees often occurs (e.g. ADI)
green : NA
darkgreen : Where native groundcovers are prevalent natural regeneration of canopy cover is very strong - in over 300 CPW management sites we've always had high (sometimes too high) natural recruitment of trees where native groundcovers are present


NA
darkblue : NA
red : planting causes increase after 20yrs
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Canopy planting makes for a rapid increase in cover. Highest density likely to occur at 40 y with crown maturation before self thinning occurs
orange : High-intensity management is likely to involve major plantings to increase tree cover, possibly leading to an overabundance of tree-cover in the short-to-medium term, but likely to lead to a more balanced outcome in the long-term
green : NA
darkgreen : No additional gains by assisted revegetation (it is possible to achieve higher tree densities however these represent a DECLINE in biodiversity value and not factored here)


15. TG-Cover-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : native canopy gradually replaced by olive in lower bound, locked stand in upper bound
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Continual decrease of condition as failure to recruit through the thickened midstorey
orange : dense sub-canopy of olives will prevent major tree recruitment unless major intervention is done, although some small increase in cover from tree growtth is possible
green : NA
darkgreen : Lower quality of groundcovers mean little canopy replacement for this category; regional dieback is also exacerbated in association with woody weeds


NA
darkblue : NA
red : eucs increase by growth & recruitment with olive control in lower bound but slowing over time, some self thnining in upper bound increasing as some individuals senesce
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Cover bounce likely as recruitment happens following weed control but will likely plateau following the 60 year period.
orange : Low-intensity management may make some small inroads into major weeds (e.g. Olives) leading to small increases in tree cover, but unlikely to lead to major improvements in tree recruitment without 'industrial' weed management occuring
green : NA
darkgreen : Have observed strong short-term recovery of canopy in this circumstance once woody weeds treated; anticipate recruitment to influence 40-60 year timeframes in similar positive manner


NA
darkblue : NA
red : olive control generates euc increase in lower bound, eucs gradually thin in upper bound
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Cover raised by planting then declines as crown matures.
orange : High-intensity management will involve removing olives and provide better opportunity for tree recruitment and/or plantring, leading to recovery/stabilisation of canopy cover over time
green : NA
darkgreen : No additional gains by assisted revegetation (it is possible to achieve higher tree densities however these represent a DECLINE in biodiversity value and not factored here)


16. TG-Cover-High
NA
darkblue : NA
red : grazing does not dramatically affect survival of trees but reduces recruitment in lower bound - marginal declne, thinning in upper bound
pink : Best estimate identifies natural recruitment to more forest like state with exclusion of high intensity fires as surrounding development limits these 
lightblue : General decline of tree cover on the site through senescence and slow recruitment
orange : Typical private land management of a high-quality remnant is likely to lead to some deterioration in tree health and cover over time, but counter-acted to some degree by natural tree recruitment and resilience
green : NA
darkgreen : General canopy decline in region (e.g. grey box psyllid) does not generally impact high quality sites; any such losses are overtaken by recruitment. Problem for many sites is overrecruitment of trees


17. GG-Cover-Low
NA
darkblue : NA
red : ongoing suppression of native grasses by grazing, possibly some decline uder worse case scenario
pink : Spread of structural changing species, manily olive, causing removal of any groundcover growth
lightblue : Gradual decline of grasses under general management
orange : Some native Grasses likely to remain in low cover despite unsympathetic management, but there is also a chance that they may stage a partial recovery , (e.g.) if a couple of fires occur a few years apart.
green : NA
darkgreen : These species are those that survive regardless, and will continue to do so in the same abundance under business as usual


NA
darkblue : NA
red : expect some increase in cover if lovegrass controlled, with benefit diminishing over time and even declining
pink : Progressive removal of competing exotic groundcovers 
lightblue : Grass cover will increase under mgt then plateau as tree cover shades out further increase
orange : Introduction of fire and some weed management is likely tro boost native grass cover, at least for 2-4 years following the fires (upper estimate), but the effect will be transitory without regular and/or significant weed control action (lower estimate)
green : NA
darkgreen : Extensive practitioner experience in the Cumberland Plain is that sites with poor groundcovers do not naturally recover groundcovers without extensive restoration (e.g. scalping) although minor gains can be made through competitive exclusion


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Scalping generates iniitIal increase but not wholly sustained because of site legacies
pink : Allows for complete removal of exotic groundcovers in a best case scenario - and given ongoing high intensity over 60 years then similar result in best estimate
lightblue : cover plateauing as canopy crowns
orange : Regular biurning accompanied by significant weed control effort is likely to lead to a significannt and sustained improvement in native grass cover, which will be sustained over time if management is sustained at maintenance levels
green : NA
darkgreen : Grassy-groundcover' (scalp and seed) monitoring by GS LLS shows very good initial results but low resilience and a natural attrition of gains over time


18. GG-Cover-Med1
NA
darkblue : NA
red : Native grass cover declines in response to intensification of agricultural mgt, hobby farms, etc
pink : Likely incursions of structiural changing weeds in lower bound - olive
lightblue : Gradual decline under the influence of competing grasses
orange : Native grass cover likely to decline under typical 'benign' private management (over-grazing, lack of fire), and even more if agriculture practised
green : NA
darkgreen : Site management is fairly consistent - what has survived generally continues to do so. There is a risk of declines and this is observed with a minority of sites, typically through unauthorised or inappropriate land use changes. A significant number of sites also improve through benign neglect as transition from production grazing to hobby farm use


NA
darkblue : NA
red : lower boiund stable or slight increase in response to continuation of mgt regime similar to historic. Upper bound (change from low stocking rate to no livestock may promote slight increase in trees & shrubs at expense of grasses, but should not be major due to limited historic disturbance to soils
pink : Low intensity removes those structural issues so change is at lower bound only. Assumes upper bound didn't have the structural issues and the low management has kept them at bay
lightblue : gradual upward improvement as weed species are addressed
orange : Introduction of fire and some weed control likely to increase covver of native grasses, with major issue being whether transformative weeds (Love Grass) prevent native re-establishment
green : NA
darkgreen : We generally find a strong increase of groundcover in this scenario, however this is not the case with all sites (hence the lower bound)


NA
darkblue : NA
red : lower bound has slight increase, upper bound  declines as trees increse in response to planting via similar mechanism to those for low intensity mgt
pink : As for low intensity but more ability to remove other competing exotic groundcovers
lightblue : sharp upward rise, then a plateauing of grass at a stable density under management
orange : High-intensity management will deal with Love Grass, and introduction of fire and weed control will allow native grasses to thrive - responsive management will also increase balance of herbs cf to  grasses 
green : NA
darkgreen : There is no additional gain in the long term by more intensive management where a core base of native groundcovers is already present; this is more resilient than scalping and revegetating, so more expensive techniques deliver less result here (despite initial peak)


19. GG-Cover-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : Ongoing decline of native grass cover
pink : Increase impacts of Olive completely changing structure of community
lightblue : groundcover likely dominated by perennial exotic pasture grasses
orange : Presence of olives will preventr re=establishment of grasses, and over time, will likely slightly reduce them.
green : NA
darkgreen : The groundcover that can survive this state generally continues to do so, but some loss possible through landclearing etc


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Stable or minor increase in grass cover which is most limited by dense eucs and olive, initial increase due to olive control, but shading by eucs later increases
pink : Progressive clearing of any structural issues allowing regrowth of cover, mostly occuring in first 20 years
lightblue : gradual increase with mgt of certain weed species but no high-intensity effort to manage for native dominance
orange : Introduction of fire and some weed control may increase space for grass recruitment to a small degree, but major success not likely without significant managment effort
green : NA
darkgreen : Generally this condition state has at least some suppressed species (bud and seed bank). These strongly recover in cover (but only moderately in diversity) when suppressing canopy is removed


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Increase in response to olive control and planting, but only partly sustainable as eucs increase
pink : Upper bound and best estimate assumes teh management also includes thining of native canopy to ensure coverage can progress. Lower bound provides less of that activity
lightblue : targeted effort to manage exotic competiive grassses
orange : Major weed control efforts coupled with burning will reduce impact of transformative weeds and make room for grass re-establishment
green : NA
darkgreen : Intensive management generally does little to improve recovery of this condition, although heavy seeding shortly after clearing woody weeds can significantly improve results


20. GG-Cover-High
NA
darkblue : NA
red : Immediate & sustained reduction in grasses due to direct grazing and livestock trampling, incursion of weeds, posibly some fertiliser use when there had been little historically
pink : High quality site with benign neglect will be over run by Olive over 60 years. The alternate is that it has had grazing to limit Olive growth so the cover reduces anyway.
lightblue : May maintain or improve a small amount (under mgt of exotic weed grasses) but more likely to continue to decrease in condition
orange : private land management is likely to involve a reduction in fire frequency whichc will reduce native grass vitality (pklus issues of grazing pressure).  Lack of specific weed management likely to allow other weeds to intrude
green : NA
darkgreen : There is little to no observed decline in coverage in high quality sites. Some confidence built in to account for changes to land management. Both positive and negative changes observed to be about equal - many intensively managed sites now converted to lifestyle with stocking and firewood harvesting reduced (biodiveristy gains) while others undertaking clearing
