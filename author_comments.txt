1. TG-Low
NA
darkblue : NA
red : probability of some opportunist (acacia) recruitment, also some dieback of existing loners
pink : Typical activities change from current to more urban residential influence but these don't really impact trees
lightblue : Status quo or gradual decline over time
orange : It often takes positive management intervention to prevent trees establishing - in the absence of such intervention recruitment opportunities are likely to occur occasionally
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : removal of grazing allows volunteer recruitment from eucs with seed source and acacias
pink : Have planted nothing but some new species likely to emerge - probably Acacias
lightblue : species diversity will increase through slow colonisation
orange : Some basic natural recovery& recuitment facilitated by better management - assumption that site is not conmpletely isolated wrt recruitment inputs
green : NA


NA
darkblue : assuming high intensity management results in adding tree species 
red : worst case - few spp planted and not all persist; most commonly modest diversity planted and nearly all survive, some supplementary planting after 40 yrs. Even with generously diverse plantings, 6 spp/plot is reasonable upper bound
pink : Relatively easy to put this timber back in under high intensity - as site matures diversity in any one plot dials back due to maturity or senescence
lightblue : active restoration plantings are likely and required in the scenario
orange : Assumption that diverse plantings of trees are likely in first years, gradually reduced by attrition
green : assuming high intensity management results in adding tree species 


2. TG-Med1
NA
darkblue : NA
red : stochastic recruitment from dispersal assume intensification of modest historic grazing regime to 'typical' levels, attrition of old trees
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : senescence and failure of recruitment is likely. Species composition changes may not be reflected in diversity
orange : It often takes positive management intervention to prevent trees establishing - in the absence of such intervention recruitment opportunities are likely to occur occasionally, e.g. after fires
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Marginally different from previous, given low levels of grazing in that scenario
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : likely to lead to a general improving trend
orange : Some basic natural recovery& recuitment facilitated by better management - assumption that site is not conmpletely isolated wrt recruitment inputs
green : NA


NA
darkblue : changed rise from linear to curvilinear with faster increase early on
red : best case scenario - planting to benchmark results in self sustaining tree diversity. Upper bound based on overplanting. Lower bound,a few plantings fail to survive
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : Planting of species into a depauperate site lacking canopy
orange : Assumption that diverse plantings of trees are likely in first years, gradually reduced by attrition
green : changed rise from linear to curvilinear with faster increase early on


3. TG-Med2
NA
darkblue : Loss of tree species as woody weeds grow and dominate
red : "locked stand" entry of new spp largely prevented by dense canopy or transformers & grazing some chance of stochastic colonisation in future, sepcially as stand structure opens >40yrs
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : gradual, long-term decline through senescence
orange : Dense weed cover limits natural (unassisted) recruitment, likely that trees which die willl not be replaced, esppecially as fire is unlikely to open structure for recruits = gradual decline
green : Loss of tree species as woody weeds grow and dominate


NA
darkblue : NA
red : partial removal of olive allows some colonisation by bird dispersal
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : slow accretion from local sources
orange : Dense weed cover limits natural (unassisted) recruitment (as per no management) and it is unlikely that low intensity management will actually improve this - however, it is possible that low intensity management may lead to slight improvement which is reflected in the lower confidence over time about the gradual decline
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : planting should restore diversity, overplanting and some attition are risks, but worst case is tat pkanting fail to survive
pink : A lot of canopy already in situ so management not likely to add new canopy
lightblue : Active planting initially gives big boost. Loss of some diversity as some species may not persist under competition from larger trees
orange : Intervention to remove weeds (olive) and add more fire imrproves recruitment, but diverse planting not required due to exiisting canopy - giving pulse of (e.g.) Acacia recruitment which is likely to gradually settle out over time
green : NA


4. TG-High
NA
darkblue : Small increase on high quality site 
red : Assumes intensification of grazing
pink : As TG Low
lightblue : Under a typical mgt scenario a gradual decline of diversity is likely to be occurring
orange : There is a fair diversity of private land management, hence the range.  I would expect a gradual decline in tree diversity without active management, but there are also likely to be occasional ;pulses of recruitment (e.g. wattles after fire) over the course of decades 
green : Small increase on high quality site 


5. GG-Low
NA
darkblue : small increase possible, but bounds are wide indicating large range of possible outcomes
red : gradual decay, but remaining natives are mostly opportunitists so decline is not massive
pink : Upper bound is benign neglect assumed the land is not developed or altered (market gardens). So status quo of what has survived the last 50 years likely to be robust to continue. Lower is heavier impacts 
lightblue : ongoing mgt is likely to retain current taxa (tolerant species / unpalatable species). History of site much longer than 60 years given here.
orange : Species remaining in these sites are likely to be quite resilient, and while there may be a gradual reduction through stochastic events, there may also be occasional recruitment, These sites are starting at a low level already.
green : small increase possible, but bounds are wide indicating large range of possible outcomes


NA
darkblue : More likliehood of a small increase over time, but still wide bounds 
red : kick up after olive control but slow colonisation without active translocation
pink : With removal of highly competitive weeds, upper limit may move but dependent on vectors to supply new species. These vectors will be limited as surrounding development occurs
lightblue : likely to have grasses disperse around a site so plots will gain species slowly
orange : These sites have great capacity for improvement, and the removal of weeds and introduction of burniing is likely to lead to new regeneration and recruitment.  Recruitment may be constrained by lack of propagules, however.
green : More likliehood of a small increase over time, but still wide bounds 


NA
darkblue : NA
red : assumes lots of planting & intensive weed & nutrient management, doubtfully self-sustaining (only through continued new plantings)
pink : Range of new species added dependent on seed availability. Results evident by year 20 then best estimate reduction as site matures and natural niches occur
lightblue : decrese happens as canopy mgt (planting, maturing) leads to a change in GG species composition which then increases again as canopy matures. Initial burst of persistent species from change in conditions (mix of open and canopy shading)
orange : High intensity management is likely to lead to a good increase in grass diversity, and may include introduction of native spp.  There may be limitations due to historic fertiliser use, but this is perhaps not so likely to affect grass spp. presence, as relative dominance 
green : NA


6. GG-Med1
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay in response to grazing intensification
pink : As for GG Low
lightblue : site likely to have been in similar condition state decline for an extended period.
orange : In the absence of positive management, very likely that natives will decline and weeds become more dominant
green : NA


NA
darkblue : Small increase possible over time, wide bounds again however
red : maintains diversity (worst case) or slight improvement due to continuation of mgt similar to historic
pink : As for GG Low
lightblue : Grass and grasslike species are more likely to respond to basic mgt inputs
orange : Introducion of some management, and esp. burning and weed control, likely to increase grass diversity 
green : Small increase possible over time, wide bounds again however


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Initial enhancement not sustainable as trees increase in cover. Further plantings in decades hence also struggle to persist for same reason
pink : Site fairly resilient as evidenced by reasonable original diversity so additional species that have been added are more likely to continue
lightblue : Curve of species diversity is likely to reflect an increase in canopy initially, then a change in composition from a sun loving to a shade tolerant complex of taxa
orange : Positive management may include reintroductions, but numbers likely to relax a little over long-term.
green : NA


7. GG-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay
pink : NA
lightblue : Likely to keep losing species under a dense olive canopy as diversity changes from graminoid form towards broadleaf forms of plants that are more shade tolerant
orange : Gradual decline, but these species are already fairly resilient, so deccline is small
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : slight kick from grazing removal may not be sustainable (marginal decline) as native trees thicken further after olive removal
pink : Progressive removal of structure changing threats with continued management however underlying soil qualities means competing groundcover weeds persist
lightblue : Removal of olives tends to result in an immediate diversity response (increased light, germination from soil seedbank) and then more taxa immigrate from refugia nearby over time
orange : Introduction of some mannagement (e.g. fire) may have small imcrease in opportunities for recruitment, but low intensity managment will not address major issue (e.g. olives)
green : NA


NA
darkblue : Big initial increase, smaller increases thereafter
red : iniitial plantings.scalping increase richness but not sustainable, assume only one scalping treatment
pink : As for low intensity management with additional species dispersed through management activities
lightblue : Likely to have a diverse planting initially and then later immigration of other taxa from refugia
orange : Removal of olives and introduction of natives will increase diversity greatly, but likely to be gradual reduction back to more 'natural' levels
green : Big initial increase, smaller increases thereafter


8. GG-High
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay in response to grazing & fert app
pink : Lower bound considers major human intervention or structural changing weeds such as Olive or Lovegrass whereas upper bound light grazing may have management benefits
lightblue : status quo may lead to general slow decline as site is managed 'as is'
orange : Again, a wide range in private land management, but I would expect a gradual decline without active management of some type
green : NA


9. FG-Low
NA
darkblue : Little change (on average) over time
red : gradual attrition
pink : Tough forbs remain - eg, Dichondra
lightblue : persistence of tolerant or annual forbs
orange : I would expect a small decline, but these species are already quite resilient, so the decline will be small.
green : Little change (on average) over time


NA
darkblue : NA
red : marginal increase with grazing removal, but largey stable thereafter - persistent legacy effects limit mgt impact
pink : removal of threats - particularly grazing could get a big rebound. This is the reason for the seemingly high upper bound
lightblue : Likely to see a rapid initial response of plants to management of the groundcover weed through herbicide and fire
orange : Some management will improve forb diversity, but likely to be limited in some sites by available propagules
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : increase with planting but not sustainable as euc cover increases, stochastic losses occur
pink : Upper bound depends on available supply - could go higher. Those that are surviving after 20 years following initial reconstruction are likely to remain with ongoing intense management and ignoring climate change
lightblue : Likely to see a quick response from diversity planting, plateau as canopy thickening occurs, then gradual increase once canopy matures.
orange : Active management will greatly increase forb diversity, perhaps above 'natural' levels
green : NA


10. FG-Med1
NA
darkblue : Some decline likely
red : decay in response to increased grazing
pink : Trends to low quality state 
lightblue : Likely to see a general decline in species as a result of mt trends (persistent tussock is the more likely occurrence)
orange : In the absence of positive management, I would expect some decline in diversity.
green : Some decline likely


NA
darkblue : NA
red : maintains or slighty improves in respose to marginal reduction in grazing, some stocahstic colonisation over time
pink : The site already has some diversity so any work will provide some rebound that should be easy to maintain with ongoing management. Vectors for new species is likely to reduce after development occurs so any new species likely to show up in first 20 years.
lightblue : Likely to see a general improvement from sward mgt and strategic grazing
orange : Introduction of some management, and particularly burning and weed control, will be likely to increase forb diversity a bit 
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : immediate increase due to transloc, slight attrition subsequently, as scalping can only occur once and some spp not sustainable without continued replacement
pink : As for low intensity management but opportunity to add from available supplies
lightblue : Likely to see a rapid gain following commencing site mgt (planting) and then a drop as canopy shading matures and species composition changes from sun tolerant to shade tolerant
orange : Active management will include re-introduction of forbs, and is likely to lead to a slightlly inflated diversity compared to natural situation
green : NA


11. FG-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : gradual decay
pink : Invasive threats progress to further impact
lightblue : Likely to see a continual decline as species are shaded out and groundcover cannot establish in olive-affected lands (allelopathic)
orange : Remaining forbs are likely to be resilient, but may gradually decline
green : NA


NA
darkblue : small increase in response to some weed control
red : initial improvement with grazing removal, hits restoration barrier (mainly dspersal)
pink : As for GG Med 2
lightblue : Control of olives leads to a rapid response of species, including many annuals and this is residual for some time although native canopy thickening and recruitment leads to a shading again and change in taxa mix
orange : some management (at least) will improve things a little, but no major change without olives actually being removed
green : small increase in response to some weed control


NA
darkblue : larger increase with high intensity management
red : initial increase due to planting not sustainable as eucs increase
pink : As for FG Med 1 but increased existing canopy limits diversity of recruitment. 
lightblue : Likely to see a rapid gain from olive mgt and planting of diversity, briefly plateauing until shade tolerant species immigrate from refugia
orange : Active management will increase diversity above 'natural' levels for a while 
green : larger increase with high intensity management


12. FG-High
NA
darkblue : Little change (on long-term average) in forb species richness over time.  Short-term responses to rainfall apparent
red : decay in response to grazing intensification
pink : Trends to low quality site due to invasive structural weeds
lightblue : Likely to see a persistent, slow decline from a good starting position as BAU practices see little mgt improvement opportunity
orange : Again, a wide range of management, but gradual decline in diversity is likely without some conscious manamgement actions being taken to prevent decline  
green : Little change (on long-term average) in forb species richness over time.  Short-term responses to rainfall apparent


13. TG-Cover-Low
NA
darkblue : NA
red : no increase is worst scenario when trees already absent, some stochastc increase possible under upper bound, some allowance for dieback on best est
pink : Following trend of past 50 years of sites left in benign neglect gaining trees. Worst case is nothing changes
lightblue : Overall the amount of tree cover is unlikely to change but it may become generally younger
orange : Private management highly variable, but  likely that some recruitmen of trees may occur over 60 years, unless very active exclusion/prevention of recruitment is happening
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : some recruitment & growth (lower & best) to woody thickening by eucs under increased CO2 and 'symptom of post-grazing repair' model (upper) 
pink : Growth and recruitment of canopy trees already in situ
lightblue : Canopy cover returns quickly under appropriate fire regime and grazing mgt
orange : Some management (removal of impacts, adding fire) will increase tree recruitment, sometimess in a major pulse which will takes decades to thin without active management
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : dense tree planting, locked stand scenario except where plantings are lower initial density
pink : Mass planting and management provides the ability to engineer this outcome. Trees are the easy win on a site that is protected and can be managed
lightblue : Canopy cover can be restored relatively quickly at low cost, although the stems will tend to be poor habitat. The likelihood of exceeding these values is also high
orange : Optimal management should result in stable tree cover, but likely to be a major pulse when recruitment limitations removed
green : NA


14. TG-Cover-Med1
NA
darkblue : NA
red : some attrition and little recruitment
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Likely to remain at similar cover percentage, but confidence decreases to reflect uncertainty
orange : Native tree species are generally resilient, but likely to be limited by ongoing grazing, competition from exotic ground cover and lack of burning
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : some grwoth and auto-recruitment, starts to abate in upper bound
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Will see a slow increase in tree cover under mgt
orange : Exclusion of grazing, burning and weed management will greatly improve tree recruitment, but it may be limited by low initial cover limiting numbers and distribution of propagules- however general experience across western Sydney has shown that vigorous recruitment of trees often occurs (e.g. ADI)
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : planting causes increase after 20yrs slight thnning effects
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Canopy planting makes for a rapid increase in cover. Highest density likely to occur at 40 y with crown maturation before self thinning occurs
orange : High-intensity management is likely to involve major plantings to increase tree cover, possibly leading to an overabundance of tree-cover in the short-to-medium term, but likely to lead to a more balanced outcome in the long-term
green : NA


15. TG-Cover-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : native canopy gradually replaced by olive in lower bound, locked stand in upper bound
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Continual decrease of condition as failure to recruit through the thickened midstorey
orange : dense sub-canopy of olives will prevent major tree recruitment unless major intervention is done, although some small increase in cover from tree growtth is possible -established trees have a lifespan well exceeding the 60-yr time period
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : eucs increase by growth & recruitment with olive control in lower bound but slowing over time, some self thnining in upper bound increasing as some individuals senesce
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Cover bounce likely as recruitment happens following weed control but will likely plateau following the 60 year period.
orange : Low-intensity management may make some small inroads into major weeds (e.g. Olives) leading to small increases in tree cover, but unlikely to lead to major improvements in tree recruitment without 'industrial' weed management occuring
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : euc increase in lower bound, eucs gradually thin (or are actively thinnied) in upper bound as 40% cover may not be sustainable over 60 yrs and intensive mgt might involve thinning
pink : As for TG Low
lightblue : Cover raised by planting (often a density much higher than useful but including many wattles) then declines as eucalypt crown matures and wattles die off.
orange : High-intensity management will involve removing olives and provide better opportunity for tree recruitment and/or plantring, leading to recovery/stabilisation of canopy cover over time
green : NA


16. TG-Cover-High
NA
darkblue : NA
red : grazing does not dramatically affect survival of trees but reduces recruitment in lower bound - marginal declne, thinning in upper bound
pink : Best estimate identifies natural recruitment to more forest like state with exclusion of high intensity fires as surrounding development limits these 
lightblue : General decline of tree cover on the site through senescence and slow recruitment
orange : Typical private land management of a high-quality remnant is likely to lead to some deterioration in tree health and cover over time, but counter-acted to some degree by natural tree recruitment and resilience
green : NA


17. GG-Cover-Low
NA
darkblue : NA
red : ongoing suppression of native grasses by grazing, possibly some decline uder worse case scenario
pink : Spread of structural changing species, manily olive, causing removal of any groundcover growth
lightblue : Gradual decline of grasses under general management
orange : Some native Grasses likely to remain in low cover despite unsympathetic management, but there is also a chance that they may stage a partial recovery , (e.g.) if a couple of fires occur a few years apart.
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : expect some increase in cover if lovegrass controlled, with benefit diminishing over time and even declining
pink : Progressive removal of competing exotic groundcovers 
lightblue : Grass cover will increase under mgt then plateau as tree cover shades out further increase
orange : Introduction of fire and some weed management is likely to boost native grass cover, at least for 2-4 years following the fires (upper estimate), but the effect will be transitory without regular and/or significant weed control action (lower estimate)
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Scalping generates iniitIal increase but not wholly sustained because of site legacies (i.e. repeated plantings for some spp fail to persist/survive)
pink : Allows for complete removal of exotic groundcovers in a best case scenario - and given ongoing high intensity over 60 years then similar result in best estimate
lightblue : cover plateauing as canopy crowns
orange : Regular burning accompanied by significant weed control effort is likely to lead to a significannt and sustained improvement in native grass cover, which will be sustained over time if management is sustained at maintenance levels
green : NA


18. GG-Cover-Med1
NA
darkblue : Hard to predict given the range of private land management activities; no change (on average) with wide bounds
red : Native grass cover declines in response to intensification of agricultural mgt, hobby farms, etc
pink : Likely incursions of structiural changing weeds in lower bound - olive
lightblue : Gradual decline under the influence of competing grasses
orange : Native grass cover likely to decline under typical 'benign' private management (over-grazing, lack of fire), and even more if agriculture practised
green : Hard to predict given the range of private land management activities; no change (on average) with wide bounds


NA
darkblue : NA
red : lower boiund stable or slight increase in response to continuation of mgt regime similar to historic. Upper bound (change from low stocking rate to no livestock may promote slight increase in trees & shrubs at expense of grasses, but should not be major due to limited historic disturbance to soils
pink : Low intensity removes those structural issues so change is at lower bound only. Assumes upper bound didn't have the structural issues and the low management has kept them at bay
lightblue : gradual upward improvement as weed species are addressed
orange : Introduction of fire and some weed control likely to increase covver of native grasses, with major issue being whether transformative weeds (Love Grass) prevent native re-establishment
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : lower bound has slight increase, upper bound  declines as trees increse in response to planting via similar mechanism to those for low intensity mgt
pink : As for low intensity but more ability to remove other competing exotic groundcovers
lightblue : sharp upward rise, then a plateauing of grass at a stable density under management
orange : High-intensity management will deal with Love Grass, and introduction of fire and weed control will allow native grasses to thrive - responsive management will also increase balance of herbs cf to grasses 
green : NA


19. GG-Cover-Med2
NA
darkblue : NA
red : Ongoing decline of native grass cover
pink : Increase impacts of Olive completely changing structure of community
lightblue : groundcover likely dominated by perennial exotic pasture grasses
orange : Presence of olives will preventr re-establishment of grasses, and over time, will likely slightly reduce them.
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Stable or minor increase in grass cover which is most limited by dense eucs and olive, initial increase due to olive control, but shading by eucs later increases
pink : Progressive clearing of any structural issues allowing regrowth of cover, mostly occuring in first 20 years
lightblue : gradual increase with mgt of certain weed species but no high-intensity effort to manage for native dominance
orange : Introduction of fire and some weed control may increase space for grass recruitment to a small degree, but major success not likely without significant managment effort
green : NA


NA
darkblue : NA
red : Increase in response to olive control and planting, but only partly sustainable as eucs (& litter) increase
pink : Upper bound and best estimate assumes teh management also includes thining of native canopy to ensure coverage can progress. Lower bound provides less of that activity
lightblue : targeted effort to manage exotic competiive grassses
orange : Major weed control efforts coupled with burning will reduce impact of transformative weeds and make room for grass re-establishment
green : NA


20. GG-Cover-High
NA
darkblue : Long-term average may remain approximately constant; short-term changes driven by rainfall. Wide bounds again
red : Immediate & sustained reduction in grasses due to direct grazing and livestock trampling, incursion of weeds, posibsly some fertiliser use when there had been little historically
pink : High quality site with benign neglect will be over run by Olive over 60 years. The alternate is that it has had grazing to limit Olive growth so the cover reduces anyway.
lightblue : May maintain or improve a small amount (under mgt of exotic weed grasses) but more likely to continue to decrease in condition
orange : private land management is likely to involve a reduction in fire frequency which will reduce native grass vitality (plus issues of grazing pressure).  Lack of specific weed management likely to allow other weeds to intrude
green : Long-term average may remain approximately constant; short-term changes driven by rainfall. Wide bounds again
