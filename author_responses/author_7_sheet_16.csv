Comment (optional),"Landscape scale decline is expected, outbalanced by natural regeneration which occurs strongly where native groundcovers are present, but balanced by land management (grazing or slashing). Our observation is that across the Cumberland Plain tree cover is increasing on unmanaged lands",,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),Where native groundcovers are prevalent natural regeneration of canopy cover is very strong - in over 300 CPW management sites we've always had high (sometimes too high) natural recruitment of trees where native groundcovers are present,,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),No additional gains by assisted revegetation (it is possible to achieve higher tree densities however these represent a DECLINE in biodiversity value and not factored here),,,,,,,,,
