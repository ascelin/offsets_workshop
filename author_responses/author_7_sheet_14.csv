Comment (optional),"Derived native grassland forms include many of the best remaining examples of this ecosystem; generally biodiversity declines associated with structure in this ecosystem have been associated with thickening of structure, either excess of trees (e.g. documented extinctions of grassy woodland specialist species during thick tree regeneration on NPWS reserves after exclusion of cattle) or encroachment of native or exotic shrubs. Lack of tree cover is not the biodiversity issue here and has been pursued through inappropriate management responses against expert land manager recommendations",,,,,
