Comment (optional),"Exclusion of grazing, burning and weed management will greatly improve tree recruitment, but it may be limited by low initial cover limiting numbers and distribution of propagules- however general experience across western Sydney has shown that vigorous recruitment of trees often occurs (e.g. ADI)",,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),"High-intensity management is likely to involve major plantings to increase tree cover, possibly leading to an overabundance of tree-cover in the short-to-medium term, but likely to lead to a more balanced outcome in the long-term",,,,,,,,,
