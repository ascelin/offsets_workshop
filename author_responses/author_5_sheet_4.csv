Comment (optional),"Dense weed cover limits natural (unassisted) recruitment (as per no management) and it is unlikely that low intensity management will actually improve this - however, it is possible that low intensity management may lead to slight improvement which is reflected in the lower confidence over time about the gradual decline",,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),"Intervention to remove weeds (olive) and add more fire imrproves recruitment, but diverse planting not required due to exiisting canopy - giving pulse of (e.g.) Acacia recruitment which is likely to gradually settle out over time",,,,,,,,,
