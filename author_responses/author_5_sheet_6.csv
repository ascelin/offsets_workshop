Comment (optional),"Species remaining in these sites are likely to be quite resilient, and while there may be a gradual reduction through stochastic events, there may also be occasional recruitment, These sites are starting at a low level already.",,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),"These sites have great capacity for improvement, and the removal of weeds and introduction of burniing is likely to lead to new regeneration and recruitment.  Recruitment may be constrained by lack of propagules, however.",,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),"High intensity management is likely to lead to a good increase in grass diversity, and may include introduction of native spp.  There may be limitations due to historic fertiliser use, but this is perhaps not so likely to affect grass spp. presence, as relative dominance ",,,,,,,,,
