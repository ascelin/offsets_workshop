Comment (optional),removal of threats - particularly grazing could get a big rebound. This is the reason for the seemingly high upper bound,,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),Upper bound depends on available supply - could go higher. Those that are surviving after 20 years following initial reconstruction are likely to remain with ongoing intense management and ignoring climate change,,,,,,,,,
