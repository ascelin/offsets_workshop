Comment (optional),"Landscape scale decline of trees is well documented in both unmanaged (for NRM) and intensively managed (for NRM) sites across the cumberland plain. This is offset by natural recruitment on native pasture, but such recruitment is very rarely observed on exotic pastures where canopy is typically remnant from before intervention. Land management (slashing, grazing) further reduces this",,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),Revegetation can increase cover however observion is that this generally declines over time where native groundcovers are not prevalent,,,,,,,,,
