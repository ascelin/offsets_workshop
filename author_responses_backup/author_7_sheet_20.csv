Comment (optional),"Site management is fairly consistent - what has survived generally continues to do so. There is a risk of declines and this is observed with a minority of sites, typically through unauthorised or inappropriate land use changes. A significant number of sites also improve through benign neglect as transition from production grazing to hobby farm use",,,,,,,,,

Comment (optional),"There is no additional gain in the long term by more intensive management where a core base of native groundcovers is already present; this is more resilient than scalping and revegetating, so more expensive techniques deliver less result here (despite initial peak)",,,,,,,,,
