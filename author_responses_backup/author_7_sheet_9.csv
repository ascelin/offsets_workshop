Comment (optional),There is little observed decline in species diversity in high quality sites. Sites which have survived the previous 200 years of abuse to retain this level of diversity generally remain resilient. However some decline in forbs and herbs can occur through new pressures from adjoining land uses in certain instances,,,,,,,,,
